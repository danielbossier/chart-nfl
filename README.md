# chart-nfl
 Rank Teams by How Good and How Likeable

Currently running into error with webpack
- TypeError: react_dom_client__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1___default.a.render is not a function

in ./src/index.js
D:/Coding Projects/GitHub/chart-nfl/src/index.js:6

Will then need to troubleshoot importing data into plot


Will need to create scatter plot with custom images as the points
This is possible:
